    "is the process of grouping images into clusters such that the\n",

    "\n",
    "VGG is a convolutional neural network model for image recognition proposed by the Visual Geometry Group in the University of Oxford, where VGG16 refers to a VGG model with 16 weight layers, and VGG19 refers to a VGG model with 19 weight layers. The architecture of VGG16: the input layer takes an image in the size of (224 x 224 x 3), and the output layer is a softmax prediction on 1000 classes. From the input layer to the last max pooling layer (labeled by 7 x 7 x 512) is regarded as the feature extraction part of the model."
